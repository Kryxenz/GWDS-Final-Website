            <p>This is my poster design that I have made using the CARP principle.
                The CARP principle consists of contrast, alignment, repetition and proximity.
                For contrast, I used a light blue and orange for the text and shapes to contrast with the background lighting of the poster image to give it a warm atmosphere within it.
                I implemented alignment by through the use of the text and shapes that I added.
                The text is aligned on the outsides of the poster with big bold texts in different fonts being the focus and attention to the user whilst also using a bright blue to catch the eye.
                This makes it easy for someone to read the poster and to consume the information in a chronological order.
                I used shapes as a form of repetition to create different patterns that repeat throughout the poster.
                There is also the repetition of the use of colours as all blue coloured text is important information, orange and white gradient text is centered around dates and extra information and orange coloured text is used for the location and the prices.
                I implemented proximity by creating whitespace in the middle of the poster to create space on the edges of the image for text.
                Their is also a hierarchy with different levels within the poster for the user to focus on different areas of the poster.
