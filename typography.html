            <p>Typographic systems are used by designers break free from traditional rulesets and to use other guidlens and elements to create what they desire.
                There are many design systems in place which I have used for different designs for my typographys. The axial system consists of a layout with central axis on either the vertical or horizontal.
                Symmetry and alignment are also a key role shown in my typography where i mirror the text layout on both sides and align them together.
                For this piece I used the futura font.

            <div class="typobox1">
                <h3>Radial</h3><br>
                <div class="typoimg1">
                <img src="img/radial.png"
                width="400"
                height="400">
                </div>
            <br>
        <p>For the radial typography, I started off with a central point made from a circle. I then used shapes to divert from the central point that also included text.
            The elements are also balanced evenly around the central point with a consistant visual flow which catches the eye of the viewer to focus firstly at the central point then outwards.

            <div class="typobox2">
                <h3>Dilational</h3><br>
                <div class="typoimg2">
                <img src="img/dilational.png"
                width="400"
                height="400">
                </div>
            <br>
            <p>For the dilational typograpgy, I was inspired by the inside patterns of tree trunks as the rings can be the layout of text.
                All the text is curved and focusing onto the whitespace of the centre point. This is a contrast from the rings on a tree trunk where the rings in a tree trunk dilate outwards from the centre, the curves of texts in my typography dilate inwards and towards the centre.
                For this piece I used the adobe garamond font.

            <div class="typobox3">
                <h3>Grid</h3><br>
                <div class="typoimg3">
                <img src="img/grid.png"
                width="400"
                height="400">
                </div>
            <br>
            <p>The grid system consists mainly of a grid structure. This is suplemented withthe use of alignment, consistency, margins and padding.
                I present these elements by aligning the title onto the ledt side and the rest of the text spaced out to it and all spaced and lined up evenly.
                For this piece I used the komet font.

                <h3>Random</h3><br>

                <img src="img/random.png"

                height="400">
                </div>
            <br>
            <p>The random system is what it says on the tin, it consists of the use of randomisation for everything!
                This could be irregular placement of text and shapes, a wide variation with colour or simply having no rulesets in place and creating whatever you please.
