                <p2> Week 1 of the worksheet was very simple. It taught us how to setup a github repository and how to create an index.html file
                </p2>

            </div>

            <div class="codingbox2">
                <h3>Week 2 Worksheet</h3>

                <div class="worksheet2">
                <img src="img/coding/week 2 1.png"
                width="650"

                <img src="img/coding/week 2 2.png"
                width="450"

                </div>

                <br>

                <p2> Week 2 of the worksheet taught me how to use different tags within html such as headings, paragraphs and lists. It also taught us how to hyperlink words and add images.
                </p2>
                
            </div>

                <div class="codingbox3">
                    <h3>Week 3 Worksheet</h3>

                    <div class="worksheet3">
                    <img src="img/coding/week 3 1.png"
                    width="150"
                    height="200">
                    <img src="img/coding/week 3 2.png"
                    width="900"
                    height="450">
                    </div>
    
                    <br>
    
                    <p2> Week 3 of the worksheet taught me how to create and use a stylesheet. This is very helpful as if you have repeating tags that need to be styled,
                        you don't have to constantly copy and paste but instead can be written once and any style using that tag will be applied!
